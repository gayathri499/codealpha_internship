Disease Prediction from Medical Data
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to have a certain disease based on various medical features. It uses a RandomForestClassifier to analyze medical data and provide predictions.

Overview
The goal of this project is to create a disease prediction system based on medical data. The model uses various health parameters to predict if a patient has a particular disease. This is done using a classification algorithm, specifically a Random Forest model.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeAlpha_Disease_Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd CodeAlpha_Disease_Prediction
Install the necessary libraries:
nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains medical information, including parameters like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, and more. These features are used to predict whether a disease is present or not. Please upload your dataset when running the project.

Model Implementation
The model is built using the RandomForestClassifier from the sklearn library. Below are the steps involved in the model building process:

Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing data
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
Model Training:
The RandomForestClassifier is trained on the training data.
Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Results
Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on a test dataset, and the following results are displayed:

Model Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Confusion Matrix: A heatmap visualizing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Prediction Function
The predict_disease function takes input data and makes predictions based on the trained model. The input data is standardized before passing it to the model for prediction.

Example Usage:
python
Copy
Edit
sample_data = [63, 1, 3, 145, 233, 1, 0, 150, 0, 2.3, 0, 0, 1]  # Example input
print("Prediction Result:", predict_disease(sample_data))
This will output either "Disease Detected" or "No Disease" based on the prediction made by the model.

Usage
To use the disease prediction model:

Upload your dataset.
Run the code to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
Use the predict_disease function to make predictions for new patients.
